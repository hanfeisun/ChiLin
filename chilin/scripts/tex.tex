\maketitle
\abstract{Modern High Throughput experiment analysis always output large amount of information, which sometimes may confuse us. An objective system of assessment throughout all Chip-seq pipeline has been established to
avoid such confusion, Here is a comprehensive report on it.If any question, please contact us.}

\section{Reads Genomic Mapping QC measurement}
\begin{quotation}
Modern high throughput sequencers can generate tens of millions of sequences in a single run. Before analysing this sequence to draw biological conclusions you should always perform some simple quality control checks to ensure that the raw data looks good and there are no problems or biases in your data which may affect how you can usefully use it.
\end{quotation}          



\subsection{FastQC Summary table}
\begin{quotation}
FastQC aims to provide a QC report which can spot problems which originate in the sequencer. 
The sequence quality score\footnote{* use 25 as cutoff}  listed in the table allows you to see if a subset of your sequences have universally low quality values. Here we can report the sequence quality scores of the new datasets and use our criteria to judge the quality of the new raw data(Table ~\ref{fastqctable}).\\

\subsection{FastQC score distribution}
We draw the cumulative percentage plot of the sequence quality scores of all historic data and show the sequence quality score of each your new data(Figure ~\ref{fastqcplot}). \newline
